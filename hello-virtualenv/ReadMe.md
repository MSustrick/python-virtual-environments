## VirtualEnv
Notes for Virtual Env

VirtualEnv isn't as good because the windows wrapper doesn't have as good of functionality as pipenv. mkproject ect doesn't work as well. small edit


Pip Install - pip install virtualenv
pip install virtualenv
For windows need to also install VirtualEnvWrapper-win
